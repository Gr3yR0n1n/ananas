How to get starting in Ananas development
-----------------------------------------

NOTE: This guide will only consider the 64-bit x86 version (amd64) - anything else is deprecated!

All commands should be executed from the root directory where you cloned the Git repository.

1) Create a bootable disk image

This is outlined in disk-image.txt; you should keep the image mounted at /mnt before you build the kernel (as the
resulting image will be copied there)

2) First step is to build a toolchain: this will create a custom GCC which compiles things using Ananas settings:

If you have a recent GCC, you will need to apply the patch from https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2015-08/msg00375.html

$ cd toolchain
$ mkdir prefix.amd64
$ make ARCH=amd64

3) Build necessary tools

'config' is used to convert a kernel configuration to Makefile's and such:

$ cd kernel/tools/config
$ make

'mb-stub' is multiboot-compliant stub to allow GRUB to boot our 64 bit kernel:

$ cd mb-stub-amd64
$ make

3) Configure the kernel

$ cd kernel/arch/amd64/conf
$ cp LINT TEST
$ $EDITOR TEST
$ ../../../tools/config/config TEST

4) Configure the kernel

$ cd kernel/arch/amd64/compile/TEST
$ $EDITOR m.sh

And place the following into it (update the TOOLCHAIN directory with where you cloned the repository)

#!/bin/sh -e
ARCH=amd64
TOOLCHAIN=~../ananas/toolchain/prefix.${ARCH}
make CC=${TOOLCHAIN}/bin/${ARCH}-elf-ananas-gcc LD=${TOOLCHAIN}/bin/${ARCH}-elf-ananas-ld $@
strip -o /tmp/kernel kernel
cat ../../../../../mb-stub-amd64/mbstub /tmp/kernel > /mnt/kernel

$ chmod 755 m.sh

5) Build

$ ./m.sh

This should yield a kernel binary, kernel, and copy the multiboot-compliant kernel image to /mnt

6) Run!

You will need a QEMU to do this (or real hardware; anything else is unsupported). This is
illustrated in the 'qemu.txt' file.
