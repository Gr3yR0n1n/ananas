The only semi-supported ARM target is currently the SheevaPlug - likely, the
GuruPlug will also work.

In order to build an image, a recent version of U-Boot is needed (this is
required because U-Boot cannot reliable boot ELF files - it does not correctly
initialize data). I used the following instructions to get it to work (based on
http://plugcomputer.org/plugwiki/index.php/Re-building_the_kernel_and_U-Boot)

Note that this requires a different ARM toolchain - for some reason, using the
Ananas ARM toolchain results in __udiv3 and friends being undefined and an
internal error. A toolchain can be downloaded at
https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release2032 - it must be
added to the path before continuing.

$ git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot-marvell.git u-boot-marvell.git
$ cd u-boot-marvell.git
$ git checkout -b testing origin/testing 
$ make mrproper
$ make sheevaplug_config
$ make u-boot.kwb CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-

The resulting binary 'mkimage' should be stored at a sensible place so that
the Makefile can find it.
