PSIM is a PowerPC emulator which is bundled with GDB. It's very usable for
development as it's quite easy to hack in the code to see what's going on.
However, it does need some tinkering to get going - I've merged several
patches from the FreeBSD emulators/psim-freebsd port:

sim/ppc/emul_chirp.c:
	Add a mapping for the kernel to obtain the mapping for the
	OpenFirmware callback.

sim/ppc/hw_cpu.c:
	Add the device type and timebase-frequency to the cpu device.
	Add code to create an instance of the cpu for the translation of the
	OpenFirmware callback.

An example .gdbinit file is provided as psim.gdbinit.

Build instructions:

$ tar xf gdb-7.3.1.tar.gz
$ cd gdb-7.3.1
$ patch -p1 < .../psim.diff
$ ./configure --enable-sim-powerpc --target=powerpc-unknown-eabi --prefix=...
