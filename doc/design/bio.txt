Basic I/O layer
---------------

The basic I/O layer (bio) is contained in kern/bio.c; it is responsible for
allocating buffers, filling them and flushing them to disk.

Two lists are used:

freelist: contains a list of unused blocks
usedlist: contains all blocks that are currently in use

The head of each list is always the most recently used block, so consequently,
the tail is the oldest block in the list. If a shortage of buffers is
encountered, the oldest buffers will be flushed until there is space for the
new request.

Data
----

There is a fixed amount of memory available for the bio buffer data. This
amount (bio_data) is divided into BIO_SECTOR_SIZE chunks. Upon allocating a
new bio buffer, data will be placed in the first available continuous
chunk.
