Device driver design
--------------------

Device management works by a bus-centeric design: there is a core bus, to which
everything is indirectly attached by use of subsequent 'real' busses; i.e.

core
  isa0
    kbd0
    vga0
    sio0
  pci0
    rl0
    em0

PCI busses can be enumerated, so in the 'pci0' case; in this case, the PCI
driver will enumerate all devices and try to attach anything that claims it's there.

Matching / attaching
--------------------

Every device driver consists of three parts:

- driver_t
  Describes a driver, with attach, detach, read, write and such.

- device_t
  Described an *attached* driver; that is a driver_t along with assorted
  resources and a driver-specific structure describe the internal state
  of the device.

  Note that there is no bus_t; a bus is identical to a device (it makes no
  sense to distinguish between the two)

- probe_t 
  Binds a driver to a bus; this doesn't mean the device unconditionally
  exists; it indicates that the driver's probe function should be called
  for this bus.
